# **CI**

## **4 Principles of CI**

Best practices of corporate identity, four key brand requirements are critical for a successful case.

- Differentiation. In today's highly competitive market, brands need to have a clear differentiation or reason for being. What they represent needs to stand apart from others in order to be noticed, make an impression, and to ultimately be preferred.
- Relevance. Brands need to connect to what people care about out in the world. To build demand, they need to understand and fulfil the needs and aspirations of their intended audiences.
- Coherence. To assure credibility with their audiences, brands must be coherent in what they say and do. All the messages, all the marketing communications, all the brand experiences, and all of the product delivery need to hang together and add up to something meaningful.
- Esteem. A brand that is differentiated, relevant and coherent is one that is valued by both its internal and external audiences. Esteem is the reputation a brand has earned by executing clearly on both its promised and delivered experience.

**The benefit of your product/service**
How exactly are you helping your target audiences?
What sets your business apart?

**4 elements of CI**

- Logo

- Imagery
- Style guidelines

[https://www.templafy.com/blog/designing-for-success-4-elements-of-corporate-identity/](https://www.templafy.com/blog/designing-for-success-4-elements-of-corporate-identity/)

Mainly Elements:

- Brand name
- Logo
- Slogan
- Standard color
- typeface
- Design style guide

## **Brand name**

The basic principles of a good name

1. harmonious in English and Chinese: including the domain name of the website, the Chinese name, the English name, or the language name of its target customer area.
2. convey the meaning: the name can indicate the meaning of the company's main business or products, is not out of the ordinary, is easy to remember and easy to spread.
3. sufficiently concise: the number of brand names < 5 Chinese characters / English is a scarce resource and there will be an increasing scarcity of brand names that are as short as possible.
4. unified name: brand names include, company name, trademark name, online shop name, web name, website domain name, self-publishing name, as unified as possible; there can be more than one set of brand names, and they are not consistent with the company name.

eg. engaged in biotechnology, take the name ××× 博泰（pinyin: botai） ×××biotech

## **Slogan**

Requirements: Number of brand names ＜Word count of tagline ＜15 Chinese characters / English

The tagline or catchphrase is a sub-title of the brand name and can be designed to be used in a variety of media materials.

eg. Examples of commercial taglines

Nike: Just Dolt!

Mac Donald: I'mlovin' it.

KFC: finger licken'good

Adidas: Nothing is Impossible

Apple: Think Different
